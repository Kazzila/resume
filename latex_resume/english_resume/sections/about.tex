Worked for 3 years as a Manual QA Engineer.
Of these, for 2 years, in addition to manual testing, I was engaged in automating games,
as well as routine work tasks using Python and discovered a passion for programming.
I am constantly working on improving my technical skills.
I like to study and put into practice new technologies to solve problems.
